	Still not convinced? C&rsquo;mon!</h3>
<p>
	Getting an exciting new role is so cool! It&rsquo;s also bloody scary. What if your new boss is actually a real dick? What if they lie about how much overtime is expected? What if your new colleagues all eat tuna for lunch and constantly stink out the staff room? Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here for. We&rsquo;ll hold your hand (not literally, of course &ndash; unless you like that) and help you steer clear of these potential workplace minefields. How? Because we know our stuff. We&rsquo;re recruitment specialists&nbsp;and&nbsp;industry experts, so we know HEAPS about the companies we recruit for and the people you&rsquo;ll work with. We&rsquo;ll look after your best interests, we promise.</p>
<p>
	Can we go all preachy for a sec? We love to&nbsp;<strong>empower people</strong>. We know this sounds very Oprah-like, but we don&rsquo;t know of a less naff way to say it. We like hooking awesome people up with awesome jobs that will make for a better life &ndash; for both you and your new boss (who will be, by the way, bloody rapt that we introduced you both. Gold star for us).</p>
<p>
	Do you have to pay for our services? No! Wash your mouth out! But we&rsquo;re open to accepting gifts once we land you a role you&rsquo;re super-stoked about. Chocolate and beer always rub us the right way&hellip;</p>
