<h1>
	WHY EMPLOYERS LOVE US</h1>
<p>
	You know those old-fashioned business relationships people used to have in the &lsquo;70s? Where they&rsquo;d pick up the phone and talk (not text) people? Where they&rsquo;d meet for a boozy lunch on a Friday? Where they&rsquo;d help each other out rather than trying to pull a fast one to make a quick buck? Well call us old-fashioned but that&rsquo;s how we like to operate at Eighty4 Recruitment.</p>
<p>
	Without sounding all Dr Phil about it, we like to create meaningful relationships with our clients &ndash; ones that become more of a partnership than a wham-bam-thankyou-ma&rsquo;m relationship. We take the time to learn about your business through face-to-face strategy meetings so we can clearly understand and articulate your key selling points. From there we devise a tactical recruitment solution that produces quality candidates in line with your exact requirements and if we can&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll tell you exactly why, talking frankly (because we&rsquo;re not ones to beat around the bush). That&rsquo;s a whole lot of words that basically say: we get to know you and then we find you the best.</p>
<p>
	We read all the CVs. We see through the bull-sh!!!!ers. We weed out the wannabes. We do all this stuff so we can simply present you with the diamonds, every time, without wasting your time or moolah.</p>
<p>
	Did we mention we&rsquo;re bloody good people? Heaps of fun, onto it, good at sharing our company expense card. We&rsquo;re in this for the long haul &ndash; want to meet us?</p>
